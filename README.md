Greppr is a simple Splunk app designed to search for specific strings in dashboards, saved searches, and event types.

v2 adds the ability to perform investigations into sourcetypes you are ingesting. This includes ad-hoc searches, saved searches, and even bucket size. This helps administrators and leaders to make those tough decisions in whether or not to continue ingesting a certain section of data.

v3 aims to fulfill the goals below:
- [x] Add support for macros
- [x] Add support for investigation lookup-generating searches
- [ ] Add support for checking for inefficient searches
- [ ] Add setup page for setting host macro
