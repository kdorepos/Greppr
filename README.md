Greppr is a simple Splunk app designed to search for specific strings in dashboards, saved searches, and event types.

v2 adds the ability to perform investigations into sourcetypes you are ingesting. This includes ad-hoc searches, saved searches, and even bucket size. This helps administrators and leaders to make those tough decisions in whether or not to continue ingesting a certain section of data.
